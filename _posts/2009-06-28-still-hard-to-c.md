The [original Hard to C blog][original] started life about 4 years ago on
Blogger. It was meant as a place I could post about the experiences I was making
while coding on my projects (mainly in C and C++).

Unfortunately it didn't get updated due to a number of circumstances, although
I have had plenty of moments along the past years where it could have been
useful letting off steam about some compiler bug or C/C++ standard issue hitting
me by surprise.

Recently I have been updating some code, which inevitably led to some new
material, so I wanted to revive Hard to C.

I talked with Mouser and Gothi[c] at [DonationCoder.com][dcc] who graciously
agreed to host the blog at this new location, I would like to take the
opportunity to express my gratitude for their help.

I added the posts from the original blog here, and I hope some new ones will
start to appear soon (when I'm done fiddling with WordPress that is hehe).
