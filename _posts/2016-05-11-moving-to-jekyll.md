I am moving this blog to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). While WordPress has
worked quite well for the past seven years, I feel it is too much effort for a
site that might as well be static.

This is pretty much the stock Jekyll generated site using the
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) light color theme,
[Source](https://github.com/adobe-fonts) fonts, and a few icons from
[Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). Source is
[here](https://github.com/jibsen/hardtoc).

One sad thing is that support for comments is gone. I could add something like
Disqus, but quite frankly I don't think it is worth it. You can always send me
an email, or find me in #donationcoder on freenode.
