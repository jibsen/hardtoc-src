Hard to C is a blog about programming. About the problems, bugs and
aha-moments you encounter while working on projects.

As the title might suggest, I do most of my coding in C or C++, so many posts
will be about those languages, though I do use other languages as well (C#,
Go, Perl, Python, Rust, assembly language, ...).

A big thanks to [DonationCoder.com](http://www.donationcoder.com/) for hosting.
