This is the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) source for the
[Hard to C](http://www.hardtoc.com/) blog.

It is pretty much the stock Jekyll generated site using the
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) light color theme,
[Source](https://github.com/adobe-fonts) fonts, and a few icons from
[Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).


Jekyll on Windows
-----------------

The Jekyll site has some slightly obscure directions for running Jekyll on
Windows. I simple installed the latest version of Ruby using
[RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) and did a `gem install jekyll`.


Usage
-----

Use `jekyll build` to generate the site into `_site`.

Use `jekyll serve` to serve the site locally for testing.
